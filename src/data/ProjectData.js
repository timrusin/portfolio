The game was originally inspired by Milton Bradley's classic BattleShip board game but then took on a life of it's own as I drew artistic vision from the 'Stranger Things' franchise.

There was a lot of struggle with accesing with we wanted from Sporify's public API, as well as trying to get user auth to work as planned. I really enjoyed working with my other team members on this project and althouhg it was rough getting through it in the time alloted, we were overall pretty proud of what we accomplished together.

We had to implement a technology into the project that we didn't learn in class together, so I deceided to build a mobil app with React Native. I also felt I struggled a bit with React.js in general on prevoisu projects so I took this on to push myself even harder. I learned a lot from it.  The app is not currently deployed anywhere, but feel free to check out the source code and even clone it down and run it if you have the ability to do so.",
