        description: "Hide and Seek is a web based game built in vanilla HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Originally inspired by Milton Bradley's classic BattleShip board game that then took on a life of its own as I drew artistic vision from the 'Stranger Things' franchise. This was my first ever dev project while attending a Software Engineering bootcamp with General Assembly.",

I really enjoyed working with my other team members on this project and although it was rough getting through it in the time allotted. Feel free to log in using: username:'user' and password:'password' to try it out.",

We had to implement a technology into the project that we didn't learn in class together, so I decided to build a mobile app with React Native. The app is not currently deployed anywhere, but feel free to check out the source code and even clone it down and run it if you have the ability to do so.",
