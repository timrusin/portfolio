### Tim Rusin Project Portfolio

I began building this website immediately following my completion of a three month, 420 contact hour software engineering course with a school called General Assembly.  

I had a very love/hate relationship with REACT.js while attending the program because I could see the benefits and posibilities with it, but I was having a hard time grasping some of the basic concepts; state management being the big one. So naturally I dove into building this portfolio site with REACT.js.  


This project not only gave me something I can showcase to the world that I am proud of, including my audio engineering/music background, but also really helped me settle in with REACT.js a bit more as I finally started making sense of props and state management.  Not to mention all the CSS practice it gave me as well.  I applied some cool user interactive, dynamic renderings on many of the pages, worked through modal reveals upon hovers, formatted completely for mobile responsiveness, and continue to add content to it on a regular basis. 


I am very proud of this site and look forward to building it out more for scalability as I complete more and more projects.
